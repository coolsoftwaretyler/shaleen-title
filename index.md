She helped create and fund the Students for Sensible Drug Policy Diversity Scholarship, which seeks to widen the perspectives and backgrounds of people joining the drug policy movement. 

In 2012, she helped make history by serving as a senior staffer for Amendment 64, Colorado’s historic initiative that made it the first state in the U.S. to legalize marijuana. She led the creation of professional coalitions including law enforcement endorsements and academic endorsements from hundreds of university professors.
