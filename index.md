<p>As of September 1, 2017, I have been appointed by the Massachusetts governor, treasurer, and attorney general to serve on the Cannabis Control Commission to honor the will of the voters and implement the marijuana law here in the commonwealth. I  am no longer associated with any cannabis businesses or organizations, and I will rarely be updating this website during my term, but you can reach me at my state email or on Twitter. Thanks for all of your good wishes!</p>
