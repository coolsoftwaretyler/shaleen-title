Thank you for your interest in connecting with me. The most direct way to dialogue with me is to become a [patron](https://www.patreon.com/parabolacenter) of [Parabola Center](http://www.parabolacenter.com) and access our private Discord server.

You can also connect with me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shaleentitle/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shaleentitle), or if you want to only see important work-related posts, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaleentitle).

For media or speaking requests, please direct inquiries to booking@shaleentitle.com. I am represented by [CCMNT speakers](https://ccmntspeakers.com/project/shaleen-title/).

**Notice for event organizers**: Before sending a speaking request, please note that I don't attend events involving Big Tobacco or its front groups. I also don't attend events run or sponsored by groups that oppose home-grow, file lawsuits against social equity, or advocate for criminal crackdowns on the legacy market. I encourage anyone who shares these values to consider adopting a similar policy.
