Today was a marathon meeting! There are several [articles](https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/06/surveillance-home-delivery-product-bans-massachusetts-marijuana-regulators-grapple-with-tough-issues-as-they-rewrite-rules.html) [up](https://www.gloucestertimes.com/news/local_news/ccc-poised-to-release-updated-pot-sale-rules/article_b1f86053-b379-5823-9f23-cf126a0e6848.html) [already](https://www.boston25news.com/news/cannabis-cafes-are-coming-to-massachusetts/961416299). I thought it would be a good time to do an old-fashioned blog post laying out the key takeaways from today's discussion. Although it became heated at certain points, those were largely inconsequential and as far as the major policy decisions were concerned, I'm proud of the discussion we had today and the collaborative result. For full context, you can find the livestream on the [Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission Facebook page](https://m.facebook.com/Massachusetts-Cannabis-Control-Commission-2085850278302810/).

We went through the following five policy areas in detail, working from excerpts of the draft regulations. These excerpts we discussed will be public shortly, if they aren't already. The full set of draft regulations will be discussed at our next meeting this Thursday June 27 (see MassCannabisControl.com for info). That draft will be open for public comment, subject to changes based on that comment, and then finalized.

Here is my personal interpretation of the most important points to know.

1. Ownership and Control 

I would generally characterize the changes we made today as making consistent the limitations on ownership and "control" in particular. One question I get a lot -- sometimes more sincerely than others -- is "But what does it MEAN to control another business?" The revised regulations will answer this question very clearly.

Two important clarifications I made:

* There is a bulleted list of what consitutes a person or entity "having rights to control." I proposed adding before the list, "including but not limited to" so that we can consider other new forms of control that may come up. This passed.
* I suggested that a license belonging to a marijuana establishment will be void if it makes a transfer of ownership or control that requires Commission approval. This passed.

2. Delivery (Adult-Use)

My general take is that what passed today is a very incremental approach to home delivery, but a major win for equity. Delivery-only retailers can deliver products from retailers to consumers. These licenses will be exclusively for Social Equity Program Participants and Economic Empowerment Applicants for at least 24 months. I am very proud of this exclusivity, which has been hard-fought and hard-won since February 2017. 

Some important takeaways:

* I feel that in order for this type of business to be viable, they need to be able to either purchase wholesale or cultivate/process their own product. The Commission has agreed to consider allowing microbusinesses to deliver their own product in our next round of regulations. I expect this an important topic for public comment.
* I am extremely concerned about the requirement for these delivery agents to wear body cameras. From my perspective, there is no basis that justifies such an invasion of privacy of people who have done nothing illegal and are simply in their own homes making a legal purchase. However, I lost this vote.
* There are questions about who can receive a delivery. I questioned whether our agency has the authority to limit who may receive a delivery of a legal product. Others felt that delivery businesses should only be able to deliver within the municipality that they are located. Ultimately, we compromised on a policy that if a city or town allows retailers to be licensed, then residents there may receive deliveries from any delivery business. I will be interested to see the public comment we receive on this.

3. Delivery (Medical)

There are several new requirements imposed on medical dispensaries, who are allowed to deliver to patients and have been doing so, as well as patients. I felt these requirements were excessive and was able to scale back some of them but not all.

* There is a new requirement for cameras in the vehicles making these deliveries. Given that there have been no criminal incidents, and the businesses are already required to have detailed manifests that are video recorded, and signed, and the agents performing the deliveries have had extensive background checks, I don't see any justifications for such surveillance. My take was that if we can't define the problem we are addressing, or whom we are protecting or why, we should not create a new regulation, but I lost that vote.
* There was a proposed new requirement that all patients should complete a "pre-verification" process before being eligible to receive delivery. I pointed out this was repetitive and unfair because patients already have gone through a long, expensive, burdensome process and suggesting removing it. This passed.
* There was a new proposed restriction preventing patients from receiving deliveries in dorms, federally subsidized housing, hotels/motels/B&Bs, etc. I suggested removing this given that patients may be traveling and needing medicine, and was able to get it scaled back and not apply to hotels/motels/B&Bs.

4. Social Consumption

After months of working collaboratively with a very engaged working group made up municipal and state officials, I am so glad to see the Social Consumption Pilot Program finally pass. It will be open to 12 municipalities. We voted 3-2 today to start with "brick-and-mortar" cannabis cafes which could potentially allow vaping indoors, with sufficient ventilation, but no smoking indoors. Event licenses are on the agenda for the next round of regulations. It will be a while until you see these open -- we still need to see a legislative technical fix to allow municipalities to opt in before the pilot program can move forward. Ultimately, I am not sure how much room there will be for adjustments given that it passed 3-2, but I am happy with where it's headed. Like delivery, these licenses will be exclusively for Social Equity Program participants and Economic Empowerment applicants, but also holders of microbusinesss and craft co-op licenses. 

5. Suitability

In my capacity as the commissioner focused on social justice, I have some MAJOR concerns about what we passed today regarding suitability, most notably that in the context of background checks, we would treat "continuances without a finding" -- which are absolutely not convictions -- as convictions. The implications of such a policy are enormous and I expect that civil rights and social justice organizations will have plenty of feedback on this. I made a motion to change it, but lost 4-1. 

6. Removal of Product

I would characterize this as a totally sensible policy, in theory. It creates a process by which the Commission could remove a category of products that are causing problems, particularly regarding attractiveness to children. I envisioned, for example, cake pops causing emergency room visits. Another commissioner suggested flavored vape cartridges. In any such case, this process would create a mechanism by which data would be evaluated and if was sufficient evidence that the product was a substantial risk to public health and safety.

I was able to add some common-sense language further clarifying that the process would be evidence-based and relative to a consistent standard. The removal could apply to specific types of products, or specific brands. However, the conversation went off the rails with regard to this  ridiculous provision listening "categories of product types" the removal could additionally apply to:

"A type of product including but not limited to marijuana seeds, marijuana clones, marijuana edibles, beverages, topical products, ointments, oils, tinctures, oral dosage forms or any other product identified by the Commission or its delegees."

So we are going to give ourselves the authority to ban the SEEDS of the plant we regulate? This was more of a matter of principle in the short-term. My motion to remove it failed 4-1, but as a consolation I was at least able to remove marijuana seeds and marijuana clones from the list which makes it less likely to end up in one of those clickbait listicles like, "You Won't Believe These Crazy Laws Really Exist." . 

7. Pre-Certification

This wasn't a specific agenda item today, but it's incredibly important and I want to highlight it. For social consumption, we created a "pre-certification" process that would allow applicants to be vetted by the Commission as having a propensity to successfully operate a business, through things like a business plan, initial background check, and policies and procedures. They would then receive a pre-certification to use as a form of credibility when attempting to work with municipalities, investors, and landlords. The most difficult parts of the application -- host community agreement, proof of capital, and proof of a property interest -- would be left for the end of the application. It sounds bureaucratic and uninteresting, but I believe that this will have a large and measurable impact for equity. Between this, exclusivity, the technical assistance we are offering, and (cross your fingers) an interest-free loan fund of the type offered by Senator Chang-Diaz, this is a viable pathway for small businesses.

I hope this recap was helpful! Again, as a disclaimer, this is my own personal interpretation from my own personal perspective; if you are looking for additional context, please watch the livestream and read the drafts. I hope this summary has provided some clarity and helped you begin to think about the topics you may want to provide public comment on. Keep an eye on the Commmission's website for the information on how to provide feedback either in person or via email. You can always send me questions and comments as well.
