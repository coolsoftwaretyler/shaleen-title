This Monday, July 29, at 10:00am in the State House, Room A-2, the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy will be holding a [hearing ](https://malegislature.gov/Events/Hearings/Detail/3241)to get feedback from the public on seven bills regarding social consumption and host community agreements.

Take a look at the website for the details. I encourage you to attend or to submit written testimony. I know it can be intimidating, but having held these hearings, I can tell you that it's very meaningful when everyday people come to share their real thoughts.

I'm not in charge of this hearing, but here are my tips:

1) Show up early! Usually, there is a sign-up sheet and you are asked to speak in the order you sign up.

2) Write a written statement and bring it with you. 

3) You will probably be asked to to keep your testimony to around 3 minutes, so practice in advance. Keep it to a few main points, and be authentic. Use your own words that you believe.

There are seven bills being heard. In my opinion, four are very good, one is very bad, and I don't have an opinion on the last two.

**Good bills on Social Consumption: S. 1125 and H. 3541** 

As you may have heard, the social consumption pilot program cannot move forward without a legal fix that would allow cities and towns to participate if they choose. These bills would allow that.

**Good bills on Host Community Agreements: S. 1126 and H. 3536**

Currently, some municipalities are requiring payments from businesses that go beyond the law, and those businesses that cannot afford the extra payments are left out. These bills would address that by making the law more clear and providing a way for it to be enforced. 

There is another bill being considered that would do the opposite; it would allow municipalities to charge extra payments without any justification.
