I am so grateful for the opportunity to have served as an inaugural commissioner from 2017-2020.  The Commission gave me a lovely [farewell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filKU3BMdtQ&feature=youtu.be) and I'm glad I got to thank so many people within the agency who shaped the Massachusetts cannabis regulatory framework for the better. If you watch the video, I didn't have notes in my lap -- I just kept looking down because I was overwhelmed!
