If you have an opinion and would like to see anything changed regarding social consumption, delivery, the economic empowerment and equity programs, or anything else in our regulations, now is the time to express it and request that change. There will be hearings in Boston and Springfield on August 14 and August 15, and you can also email your comments. You can find all of the official details [here](https://mass-cannabis-control.com/cannabis-control-commission-unanimously-approves-draft-regulations-proposing-changes-to-adult-use-medical-use-of-marijuana-programs-2/). Tip: you may want to send an email soon (the earlier we hear it, the more time we have to consider how to do it) AND come to a hearing.
