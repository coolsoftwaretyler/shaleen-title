I"ë<p>Madame Chair, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to make a comment today. My name is Shaleen Title, I previously served as a commissioner and currently I spend my time doing two things: first, examining solutions to prevent a national cannabis monopoly through a partnership with a university, and second, educating and advocating for those solutions through the nonprofit think tank Parabola Center. I have three points to make, all coming through that lens.</p>
