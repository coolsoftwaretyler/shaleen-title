I"È<p>As you may know, state law requires the Commission to include people from communities disproportionately harmed by prohibition in the legal cannabis industry. One of the ways we do this is through the Social Equity Program, which provides technical assistance, training, fee waivers, and more to people from disproportionately harmed communities. You can find eligibility requirements and the application on the <a href="https://mass-cannabis-control.com/equityprograms-2/">Cannabis Control Commissionâ€™s equity page</a>. The program has four tracks, based on an applicantâ€™s specific interests in the cannabis industry, their current skills, and the outcomes they are seeking to gain from the program.</p>
