I"è<p>Today the commission held a meeting approving a draft of the new type of delivery license, which allows equity and economic empowerment businesses to purchase products from manufacturers or cultivators and sell them to consumers. The draft we discussed today is available on our website (<a href="https://mass-cannabis-control.com/document/adult-use-draft-regulations-with-proposed-delivery-provisions-september-24-2020-commission-meeting/">adult-use</a> and <a href="https://mass-cannabis-control.com/document/medical-use-draft-regulations-with-proposed-delivery-provisions-september-24-2020-commission-meeting/">medical</a>). Shortly, it will be updated with the relatively minor changes we made today and then public comment on these specific delivery policies will be open for a couple weeks. You can find a recording of today‚Äôs virtual meeting on the MA Cannabis Control Commission Facebook page.</p>
