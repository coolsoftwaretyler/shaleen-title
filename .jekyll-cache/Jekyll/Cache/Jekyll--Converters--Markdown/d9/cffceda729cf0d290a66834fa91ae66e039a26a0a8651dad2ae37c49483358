I"<p>Along with my fellow commissioners, I spent the past two days in  Boston and Springfield hearings taking public input on the CCCâ€™s latest draft of regulations. The meetings were open to the public, and full video stream of the hearings are available on the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission Facebook page. Dozens of people testified, and some very clear themes emerged throughout the hearings. I felt a palpable sense of frustration, but also trust in us and our willingness to listen, which I appreciate.</p>
